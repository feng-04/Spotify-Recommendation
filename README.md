# Spotify-Recommendation
A program that filter spotify's featured playlists based on the user's likedsongs and the genres they enjoy the least

note: due to the nature of the negative set of data(genres that the user tend to enjoy less), the accuracy of the model is not perfect(around 80%), since it is difficult to have hundreds of songs that people really hate
